## App Description
Build a Quiz app that allows the user to create quizzes. Created quizzes should be persisted to the documents directory. The user will then be able to use those quizzes as flash cards. 

## Gif 

### Profile Creation
In this gif the app is showing an empty state as the user hasn't created any quizzes. When the user navigates to the "Create" tab an alert is shown because the user hasn't set up their profile. The user is able to create a profile including username and image from the photo library. Persist the **User** model to the documents directory along with their Quizzes.

### Adding a Quiz from the Search tab
Here the user is searching for a quiz and succesfully adds it to their quiz collection. The user is able to click on a quiz in their collection and view it using a transition view animation. The flash card first shows the quiz title then when the user taps on the card, it transitions with an animation to show the (fact) description.

## Below highlights the process of creating a quiz in the Create Quiz View Controller

1. Enter the title of the quiz. e.g Quick Sort 
2. Enter the first term (description) for the quiz. e.g Uses divide and conquer and splits the array into three parts based on a "pivot" variable.
3. Enter the second term (description) for the quiz e.g Picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot
4. After all required fields are filled in by the user, the user then taps on the "Create" button.  
5. The Quiz should now be visible in the Quizzes tab.

## Architecture 

The app has four tabs hosted by a Tab Bar Controller (storyboard can be used to create this): 

- First tab: Quizzes Tab (this is a collection view of all your quizzes). 
- Second tab: Search Quizzes Online Tab (collection view) (here you can add quizzes to your list from the Quizzes API). 
- Third tab: Create Tab (the user can create a quiz here), consist of a UITextField and two UITextViews. 
- Fourth tab: Profile Tab (shows the user's profile image and username (make the username a UIButton if in case you are attempting the extra credit portion). The user can use the photo library to change their profile image.
